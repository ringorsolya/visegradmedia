Identifying News Slant in Crisis Communication Using Artificial Intelligence.

Our project applies different text mining and natural language processing methods, including novel approaches based on language modelling and deep learning, to develop a new model for identifying slants in online news and, in this way, promote resilience against biased reporting. The project is co-financed by the Governments of Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia through Visegrad Grants from the International Visegrad Fund. The fund aims to advance ideas for sustainable regional cooperation in Central Europe.
